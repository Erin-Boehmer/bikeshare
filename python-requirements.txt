# The below packages can be installed with pip:
#    (sudo) pip install -r python-requirements.txt
# Or with conda if you're using Anaconda
#    conda install --file python-requirements.txt

# If you use other packages, please document them here, and make sure they work
# on BCE using pip!

ipython==2.2.0
Jinja2==2.7.3
matplotlib==1.3.1
numpy==1.8.1
pandas==0.14.1

pyzmq==14.3.1

# Note that BCE 0.1.x has scikit-learn 0.14.x, this is the one package you'll
# need to update on BCE, using:
#    pip install -U scikit-learn==0.15.1

scikit-learn==0.15.1

# This is Dav's favorite way to get attractive matplotlib plots
# It's not available by default from conda
# prettyplotlib==0.1.7

# A < 2.0 version of pyparsing is necessary to work in py2.7, see:
# https://code.google.com/p/pydot/issues/detail?id=81
# Other packages need it, so we include it here for safety!
# Strangely, conda insists on installing >2.0 with matplotlib
# So, we can't leave this in the file :\
# pyparsing>=1.5.6,<2
